Create a website that can act as an image holder for users. Users can save images in them with different albums. Make a homepage, about page, contact page, signup page, login page. One can add images in different albums of their choice. Make the view page of images as much beautiful as you can. Along with it, one can add description to an image. Arrange the images in such a sequence in which they are mostly liked and mostly commented.  Add a secret code for each image. The one with the link and secret key can see the image. An authenticated user can add comments and likes on the image of other user but can only access it with given link and secret key.  Elaboration- Every image has a link and each image has a secret key, the user who has created will be accessed to create the key and view the image on login without key. But the unauthenticated users are also given the access to see the image with a given link, when they touch the link, they need enter a secret key so that they can see the image.
